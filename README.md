# Pig Game
Made as part of JavaScript course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.   
By doing this project I practiced manipulating the DOM.   

## How to Play 🛝
* The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by rolling the dice and adding the numbers together.
* Players take turns rolling the dice. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all of their points for the turn.
* If a player rolls any other number, they can choose to roll again or to bank their points for the turn.
* The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

  ENJOY 😎
